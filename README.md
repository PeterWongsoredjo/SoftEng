The personal portofolio website of Peter Wongsoredjo created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

To start the program, first, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the website.

Features in the web:
- Navigation Bar, with each its own animation
- Rotating Hobbies
- Slideshow of Achievements
- Hoverable pictures of projects and referral logos

Some Difficulties while building this project:
- Changes in syntax, switching from the usual html to typescript
- Haven't made the website responsive to all device
